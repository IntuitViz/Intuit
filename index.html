             <h3>About the project</h3>
             <div class="col-md-5 explText">
                 <p class="row">Machine learning (ML) algorithms study the pattern repetitions to learn and make predictions on data. Typically, this training uses massive data sets from which the algorithm identifies which features are important. However, many times a ML Expert needs to take part in the process of tweaking the parameters. Problems arise when the algorithms are used in user-oriented systems, where the data –usually very small labeled data- reflects highly individualized behaviors or preferences. In these situations, it’s the end-user (non-expert in ML) who must be involved in training the algorithm to correct the labeling. </p>
                 <p class="row">>‘Black-box’ systems, with output that is not interpretable by a non-expert, will frustrate end users if they become dependent upon the systems. This is due to the fact that users will need to tailor and fix the systems when the systems break. This project tries to solve this situation by proposing an interactive visualization system, where different visualizations explain the raw data that were either misclassified or properly labelled. By facilitating a comparison between raw data from different classes we aim to transform the black box, making it intelligible to all the users. </p>
                 </br>
                 <h4 class="row">The Data</h4>
                 <p class="row">Our project uses a dataset (courtesy of mHealth lab at Northeastern) of acceleration data tagged with activity type that was previously acquired for a study in activity recognition. The activities labeled were: biking outdoor, biking stationary at 300 KPM/min, folding pile of towels, frisbee, in elevator going up, jumping jacks, lying on back, on escalator going up, running at 5.5 mph 5% grade on treadmill, shelf reloading, shelf unloading, sitting (plotted on the right side of the screen), standing, sweeping, vending machine, walking at 1 mph (plotted on the right side of the screen), walking at 2 mph, walking at 3 mph, walking at 3.5 mph, walking outdoor, walking stairs down, walking stairs up.</p>
                 <p class="row">We believe that showing the visual differences in the accelerations of each activity, specially in instances in which the labels were misclassified, can help experts to improve their algorithm. </p>

             <h3>Finding errors in Machine Learning results</h3>
             <p>Compared to the complex learning algorithms, the raw data and features tend to be familiar entities for the users who, usually, have a better understanding of the data has been gathered. The goal of our visualization is mainly to impart ‘actionable’ explanations of the misclassified instances.</p>
             <p>The main identification of wrong classified instances is done in three different steps. In the first one, a <span class="highlight">confusion matrix</span> allows the user to check which activities were more problematic for the algorithm by highlighting through colors which items were correctly or wrongly classified; in the second visualization, that is activated when the user clicks a cell in the matrix, an <span class="highlight">item list</span> is provided by showing the items that belong to the true label and predicted label. Finally, when clicking one of the items in the list, a <span class="highlight">visual comparison</span> between the raw data and the true label and prediction label is provided through the visualization of the three different charts. </p>
